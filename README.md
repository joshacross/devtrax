## Description
DevTrax is a fully responsive, full-stack, client-side web application deployed to Heroku Server. With DevTrax, user's are able to auto-generate contracts by simply filling out a form with client and project details. Once form has been filled out, it will generate a contract URL for their client(s) to sign.

Once their client signs, contract will become active from the date client signed and an uneditable version can be referenced at anytime.

Devtrax also offers a project calendar view, allowing them to overview project's length.
